# EXT-Tseries-ANITI
This repository has two branches: 1)the main branch which deals with udpated works on the simulation of extreme time series for wind speed and (2) the multivariate branch which deals with the multivariate adaptation.
You are here in the multivariate branch. [THE BRANCH IS STILL IN CONSTRUCTION].

2) Simulation of multivariate extreme time series accounting for temporal dependence (MV case)

For better modelling surge-induced coastal flooding, we analyse extreme time series and build a simulator of extreme time series. 
Our main contributions are the following:
- Accounting for temporal dependence and short-tailed behavior. Use of regularly varying functions, extreme value model and polar decomposition. 
- Dimensionality reduction to simulate new extreme time series based on copula models. 
- Tunable aspects, allowing to produce consecutive extremes.
- Several methods proposed to validate the simulation method, using extreme value theory, PCA decomposition and classification two-samples test. 

To run the codes, first run [Detrending_Season](./Detrending_Season.Rmd) for detrending the time series then run [Whitening](./Whitening.Rmd) for whitening them.
Finally, using the residuals displayed in folder (./residuals), run [Simul_ext_Residuals](./Simul_ext_Residuals.Rmd) and [Simul_Ext_Forcing](./Simul_Ext_Forcing.Rmd) for simulating respectively extreme residuals and extreme time series of interest. Additional results are displayed in [Complements_analysis](./Complements_analysis.Rmd). 

All details of the methods are provided in [Gorse et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13687). The methods are applied to [surge data](./Data/Data_Surge.csv) of Gavres site (French Atlantic coast). If you use these datasets, please refer to [Idier et al.
